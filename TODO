- more feedback on import
- use some JavaSript template engine instead of composing the HTML by hand?

Bugs

- "Songs" button in "Select Folder" does not look right
- If the first folder you select needs to be converted, it starts playing before
  it is actually converted, which prevents the first song form being converted
  properly
