- Add a proper README
- Fix javascript event handlers for dynamic HTML (do not add them again after
  each refresh, if at all possible)
- Use POST instead of GET for ajax calls that change state
- "Play now" button for songs in song list in queue and select_folders pages
- "play next" context menu item in tree view, maybe also in queue view
- Make it easier to move just-imported folders in place:
  - dnd in multiple windows (from one to another)?
  - context menu move-to, which opens the tree
- Think about what 'selection' in the tree view is supposed to mean
- When a collection is deleted, remove its associated converted mp3
  files, too
- Same for uploaded ZIP files
